# Nolla-Installer

---

Nolla Installer is a prototype of an installer that I made long before starting my Systems Analysis and Development graduation.

This tool was designed to simplify the installation and updating of a Minecraft modpack called "Nolla," which I also maintained. It automates tasks like copying files, cleaning old configurations, updating launcher profiles, and checking the correct version of dependencies such as Fabric Modloader.

## Features

- Detects existing installations and versions
- Makes backups of current mods before installation
- Removes conflicting files for a clean install
- Updates or creates launcher profiles with custom names and icons
- Verifies presence of required modloader and prompts for installation if missing

This code is not intended for professional distribution or commercial use. It is a simple, experimental script made for personal projects and testing.

## Disclaimer

This is an early project and may contain bugs or unoptimized sections of code. Use at your own risk.

## Future Plans

The plan was to revisit this project to implement improvements such as automated Fabric installation, better error handling, and a graphical interface. I wont touch this project any longer.
