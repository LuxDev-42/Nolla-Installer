# Nolla-Installer

---

Nolla Installer is an experimental installer prototype developed long before I started my Systems Analysis and Development degree.

This tool was designed to simplify the installation and updating of a Minecraft modpack called **Nolla**, which I also maintained at the time. It automates tasks such as copying files, cleaning old configurations, updating launcher profiles, and verifying required dependencies like the Fabric Modloader.

## Features

- Detects existing installations and installed versions  
- Creates backups of current mods before installation  
- Removes conflicting files to ensure a clean install  
- Updates or creates launcher profiles with custom names and icons  
- Verifies the presence of the required modloader and prompts for installation if missing  

This code is not intended for professional distribution or commercial use. It is a simple experimental script made for personal projects and technical exploration.

## Project Status and Versioning

This project intentionally never reached version 1.0. All releases remained in the **0.x** range to reflect its experimental nature and limited scope.

Development was discontinued after version **0.80**, when Modrinth introduced official tooling that handled modpack installation and updates in a more stable and integrated way, making this installer unnecessary.
